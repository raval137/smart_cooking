IOT based Smart Cooking

This was a part of my curriculum, where I and my team created a concept of smart cooking, based on the Internet of Things and automation. Basically it consists of various sensors connected with the Arduino module and being monitored constantly. It also has an electrically controlled whistle just like in a simple cooker, and an android app which can be used to insert parameters and get a notification. Project is still under development.
